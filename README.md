# Multilingual-number-parser

This project started as a need for Metamaze where we parse words to actual numbers.

First relied on [words-to-numbers](https://github.com/finnfiddle/words-to-numbers) but it couldn't handle multiple languages. So based on the existing code base I've rewritten the parser so it can support multiple languages.

This parser is also able to succeed in tests which [words-to-numbers](https://github.com/finnfiddle/words-to-numbers) couldn't.

Feel free to open issues/PR's to support other languages!

This wasn't possible without the authors of [words-to-numbers](https://github.com/finnfiddle/words-to-numbers).

# See the tests folders on how to use this package.

# Supported languages
